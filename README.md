# Sentence Alignment Learning for Neural Machine Translation

## In Progress ……

The demo data and source codes of the paper "[Improving Neural Machine Translation by Achieving Knowledge Transfer with Sentence Alignment Learning](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K19-1025/)"


The source code are mainly modified from [https://github.com/jiasenlu/visDial.pytorch](https://github.com/jiasenlu/visDial.pytorch) (paper: [Best of Both Worlds: Transferring Knowledge from Discriminative Learning to a Generative Visual Dialog Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01554))
